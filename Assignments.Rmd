## R Scripts
Running R code using the console (bottom left in figure below) is a great place to start, but has its limitations. Each time you want to execute a set of commands, you have to re-enter them at the command line. Complex commands are potentially subject to typographical errors, necessitating that they be re-entered correctly. Repeating a set of operations requires re-entering the code stream. To give yourself more room to work, it’s a great idea to use the R script editor.

A script is simply a text file containing a set of commands and comments. The script can be saved and used later to re-execute the saved commands. The script can also be edited so you can execute a modified version of the commands.

You can open a new empty script by clicking the New File icon in the upper left of the main RStudio toolbar. This icon looks like a white square with a white plus sign in a green circle. Clicking the icon opens the New File Menu. Click the “R Script” option and the script editor will open with an empty script. Your R Studio should look similar to below (image source: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html))

R Scripts are basically text files with a .R extension that houses your code and comments. You write your code. Execute that code from your R script. Results are produced in your R console window. In this class, we won’t be using regular R Scripts for homework assignments. Instead, we’ll be using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

R Markdown documents take script files to a new level by allowing you to mix R commands with explanatory text. Think of an R Markdown document as an R script on steroids. Your R Markdown source document is compiled into an output report evaluating the R commands in the source document to produce easily reproducible results in an aesthetically pleasing form. It combines code, results from the code, and narrative text explaining the results to produce beautiful documents and academic reports.

Still not convinced that R Markdown is useful? Check out Nikhil Kaza’s thorough description of [why we should use R Markdown](https://nkaza.github.io/intro2Rbook/why-use-r-markdown.html).

## R Markdown

R Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring html, pdf, and Microsoft Word documents in RStudio. For each R related assignment, you will upload onto Canvas two documents:

1. An R Markdown document, which has an .Rmd extension
1. A knitted `.html`, `.pdf` or `.docx` file

These documents will provide us an easy-to-read document to grade; more importantly, you will get to practice (1) writing scripts, (2) keeping track of the analyses you run, and (3) organizing your output in a reader-friendly manner. When you submit these documents on Canvas, **do not combine them into a zipped compressed folder**. They should be two separate files.

To be clear, R is a programming language. RStudio is an application. R Markdown is a markup syntax to convert R script and text into a pdf or html document. It allows for presentation-ready documents that show commands and results in a seamless flow. When you write R code and embed it in presentation documents created using R Markdown, you are forced to explicitly state the steps you took to do your research.

In RStudio, install the packages **knitr** and **rmarkdown** using the `install.packages()` command. Type the following in your RConsole window after `>`

```{r installpackages}
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Once you’ve installed these packages, you don’t need to install them any more in the future. You also do not need to load them in at any time using `library()`.

## Creating and saving an R Markdown

To create a new `.Rmd` file in RStudio, select File -> New File -> R Markdown. A window should pop up. Type in “Assignment 1” next to *Title* and your name next to *Author*r. Leave everything else alone and click OK. A new window in the top left of your RStudio console should pop up containing your new R Markdown file.

If you are using your personal computer for this guide, it’s best to set up a clean and efficient file management structure. File management is key to preventing R programming frustration. Here are some tips.

-Set up a clear and understandable hierarchical file system for this class on your hard drive. For example, create a class folder (SPH 215). Within this class folder, create the folder Assignments. Within the Assignments folder, create separate folders for each Assignment (e.g. Assignment 1, Assignment 2, …). Don’t work from your Desktop. Or from the Downloads folder. Or some randomly named folder that you will have a hard time finding a month, week or day from now. 
-Keep all your files that are related to a lab or assignment in one folder. That is, don’t have an Assignment 3 folder that contains data files specific to Assignment 1. Keep everything in one folder, including the R Markdown for that assignment or lab.

Using the basic guidelines above, save your R Markdown file into an appropriate folder on your hard drive by clicking on File and then Save from the RStudio menu.

To open an `.Rmd` file in RStudio, select File -> Open File and navigate to the folder you saved the assignment template in and select the file. You should see the R Markdown file pop up on the top left portion of your RStudio interface

##Authoring an R Markdown document

R Markdown documents contain 3 major components:

1. A YAML header surrounded by - - -
1. Chunks of R code surrounded by ```
1. Text mixed with simple text formatting using the Markdown syntax

### YAML header

The YAML header controls how R Markdown renders your `.Rmd` file. A YAML header is a section of key:value pairs surrounded by - - - marks and is always located at the top of your Rmd file.

In the assignment’s YAML, add your name, assignment number, and the date. These are the only necessary items, but you can change other options, most of which are detailed [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html). Your YAML will generally look like the following.

```{yaml}
---
title: "Assignment [insert number here]"
subtitle: SPH 215
author: Your full name here
date: Assignment due date
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: cosmo
---

```
