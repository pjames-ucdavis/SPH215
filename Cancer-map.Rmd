# Let's make a map

Here we make a map.

```{r}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjames-ucdavis/SPH215/refs/heads/main/CA_Cancer_Data.rds", "ca_cancer.rds", mode = "wb")

# Read in cancer dataset
cancer <- readRDS("ca_cancer.rds")

# Look at the data
head(cancer)
```

```{r}
table(cancer$event)
```

#load packages
```{r}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

# Let's do this map
Here is my first beautiful map of class.
```{r}
## Setting coordinate reference system (CRS) to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)--we will discuss more next week!
cancer_projected = st_as_sf(cancer, crs=4269)

## Plot the data--will also discuss more in a few weeks!
tmap_mode("view")

cancer_map = tm_shape(cancer_projected) + 
  tm_dots(size=0.5,fill_alpha=0.8, fill="event",fill.scale = tm_scale_categorical())

cancer_map
```
